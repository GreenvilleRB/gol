# Testing frameworks

There are a few branches here.  One for Rspec, one for TestUnit, one for 
TestSpec, and one for Riot.  They're the same, save for testing 
framework.  Each is on a branch:

```bash
    $ git branch
    * master
      riot
      rspec
      test-spec
      test-unit
````

# Using this starter kit

I just created a single file called `game_of_life.rb` that has the 
`Runner` class at the top and then the tests below it.  To use this 
starting point, just clone the repo, checkout the branch you want to 
work on, run `bundle install` if necessary, and hack away.
